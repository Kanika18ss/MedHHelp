		<h1>Why is our Mental Health important?</h1><br>
		<p>Positive mental health is crucial in today’s world, as it profoundly influences every aspect of our lives. Mental health can impact our thoughts, actions, and interactions. It empowers us to navigate challenges, build meaningful relationships, and make informed decisions.Maintaining a positive mental health and treating any poor mental health conditions is crucial to stabilizing constructive behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. Focusing on mental health care can increase productivity, enhance our self-image, and improve relationships. Nurturing mental health doesn’t just improve our daily functioning, but it can also help us control — or at least combat — some of the physical health problems directly linked to mental health conditions. For example, heart disease and stress are related, so managing stress might have a positive outcome on heart disease and promote a healthy lifestyle.</p>
		<p>Other benefits of taking care of our mental health can include:
			<ul style="margin-left: 10%;">
				<li>Improving our mood</li>
				<li>Reducing our Anxiety</li>
				<li>Creating an enhanced sense of inner peace</li>
				<li>Thinking more clearly</li>
				<li>Improving our relationships</li>
				<li>Increasing our self-esteem</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Beyond everything else we’ve already discussed, being mentally healthy can significantly impact our psychological, emotional, and social well-being. It directly affects our mental well-being and how we feel and act on a daily basis. Mental health is a major factor in a healthy lifestyle when we make difficult choices, deal with stress, and relate to other people in our world.<br>Yet, mental health isn’t just something we can deal with once and then get over. It’s important in every stage of our life. From infancy all the way into adulthood — mental health is something we need to be cognizant of and handle with care.</p>

		<br>
		<h1>Promotion and Prevention of Mental Health</h1><br>
		<p>Promotion and prevention interventions work by identifying the individual, social and structural determinants of mental health, and then intervening to reduce risks, build resilience and establish supportive environments for mental health. Interventions can be designed for individuals, specific groups or whole populations.Reshaping the determinants of mental health often requires action beyond the health sector and so promotion and prevention programmes should involve the education, labour, justice, transport, environment, housing, and welfare sectors. The health sector can contribute significantly by embedding promotion and prevention efforts within health services; and by advocating, initiating and, where appropriate, facilitating multisectoral collaboration and coordination.Suicide prevention is a global priority and included in the Sustainable Development Goals. Much progress can be achieved by limiting access to means, responsible media reporting, social and emotional learning for adolescents and early intervention. Banning highly hazardous pesticides is a particularly inexpensive and cost–effective intervention for reducing suicide rates.<br>Promoting child and adolescent mental health is another priority and can be achieved by policies and laws that promote and protect mental health, supporting caregivers to provide nurturing care, implementing school-based programmes and improving the quality of community and online environments. School-based social and emotional learning programmes are among the most effective promotion strategies for countries at all income levels.Promoting and protecting mental health at work is a growing area of interest and can be supported through legislation and regulation, organizational strategies, manager training and interventions for workers.</p>
